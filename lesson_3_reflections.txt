When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* When you are working col;aberatively; when you need to work from more than one local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* To prevent changes entered by collaborator from making immediate changed on desktop repository. Can be gotten later.
