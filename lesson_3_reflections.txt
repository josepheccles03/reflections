When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
* When you are working col;aberatively; when you need to work from more than one local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
* To prevent changes entered by collaborator from making immediate changed on desktop repository. Can be gotten later.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
* Clones make copy of repository from remote host
* Forks make a copy on the repository host
* Branches share the commit history before that are created, but diverge afterwards
