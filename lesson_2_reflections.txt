What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
* creates .git direcctory
* Need to commit at some point

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
* Staging area contains files that will be part of the next commit.
* Working directory is where files are edited, and may contain untracked files.
* Staging area doesn't contain untracked files - these are in working directory.
